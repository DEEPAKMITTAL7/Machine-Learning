The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. I would ike to thank Kaggle for providing the datasets to all the data science learners for free.

This dataset has some limitaions over features to safeguard for confidentiality issues with user's information.

Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'

Let's quickly analyze the data and try to observe the pattern/methodology behind the frauds.

Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

Feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning.

Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Amount less than or equal to zero is not treated as a fraud.
